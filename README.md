---

## **üîç Tool Description**

**INJEX-IA** is a powerful, automated web vulnerability scanner designed for security researchers and developers. It helps identify common vulnerabilities such as:

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
- **SQL Injection (SQLi)**
- **Sensitive File Exposure**

### **The tool includes the following core modules:**

- **Web Crawling**: Automatically navigates websites, extracts links, forms, and input fields.
- **Payload Injection**: Injects predefined payloads to test for XSS, SQLi, and sensitive file exposures.
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Analyzes HTTP responses and flags vulnerabilities with severity levels using AI models.
- **AI-Based Scanning**: Continuously improves detection accuracy by learning from scan results.
- **Reporting**: Generates comprehensive reports in JSON format, including vulnerability types, affected URLs, payloads, and risk levels.

## **‚öôÔ∏è Installation Guide for Kali Linux**

Follow these steps to install and run **INJEX-IA** using **Playwright**:

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yassinegitwork/Injex-IA-tool.git
cd INJEX-IA
```

### **2. Install Python Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This installs all the necessary Python libraries including Playwright.

### **3. Install and Configure Playwright**
INJEX-IA uses Playwright for browser automation, supporting Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.

Run the following to install Playwright and download its required browser binaries:

```bash
pip install playwright
python -m playwright install
```

‚úÖ This command will automatically download the required browsers ‚Äî no need to install ChromeDriver or GeckoDriver manually.

---

## **üß™ Optional: Enable Browser GUI for Debugging**
By default, Playwright runs browsers in headless mode (no UI). To run with a visible browser window (for debugging or visual confirmation), edit the crawler code to set:

```python
browser = await p.chromium.launch(headless=False)
```

---

## **üöÄ Running INJEX-IA**

Once setup is complete, start the tool with:

```bash
python main.py
```

You will be prompted to enter:

- The target URL
- The type of scan: **XSS**, **SQL Injection**, or **Sensitive Files**

---

## **üìÅ Scan Results**

After a scan completes, the tool will generate two important files:

### **1. scan_report.json**
Contains:

- All detected vulnerabilities (true positives and false positives)
- Vulnerability types and severity
- Affected URLs and payloads used

To view:
```bash
cat scan_report.json
```

### **2. metrics.json**
Contains:

- Performance metrics of the scan
- Data useful for AI model improvement

To view:
```bash
cat metrics.json
```

---

## **üìå Notes**

- ‚úÖ No driver setup required ‚Äî Playwright handles browsers internally.
- üîÅ Cross-browser support ‚Äî Easily switch between Chromium, Firefox, or WebKit.
- üõ†Ô∏è Works out of the box on Kali Linux without special configurations.
